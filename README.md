# Modeling the kinematics of discrete relativistic jets from black hole X-ray binaries

A repository containing Jupyter notebooks with the implementation of the external shock model (Wang et al. 2003) used to describe the motion of the relativistic ejecta from the black hole X-ray binaries MAXI J1820+070, MAXI J1535-571 and XTE J1752-223, presented in Carotenuto et al. (to be submitted), with the title "The kinetic energy of decelerating jets from black hole X-ray binaries".

The full paper can be found on (INSERT ARXIV LINK) (open access).

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks and the required angular separation data to produce the images and the calculations in the paper mentioned above. The motivations for the performed calculations and plotting settings are also included to certain extend, although we refer to the main paper for full details.

If this repository is useful for your own research, in addition to citing the original paper, please consider including a note to this repository as well.

# Software requirements

Notebooks written in Python 3, requiring the following packages:

numpy v1.15.4
matplotlib v2.2.3
aplpy v1.1.1
scipy v1.1.0
astropy v2.0.9
As noted in the Plotting Fields notebook, the created .png images are combined using external software into the composite images shown in the paper.
